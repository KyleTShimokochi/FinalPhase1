	<h3>
	<b>
	About our Health Content
	</b>
	</h3>
	
	<p>
	Our health content describes general principles of health care that should not in any event be construed as specific instructions for individual patients.
	This material is not intended as a guide to self-medication or as a substitute for proper medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. It is for reference only
	and should not be used to determine treatment for specific medical conditions--only a health care provider can do that. The Service and its health related
	information and resources are not intended and must not be taken as the rendering of medical, nursing, or professional health care advice or services, or
	the practice of medicine, nursing, or professional health care in any jurisdiction. You should discuss the information provided with a physician, pharmacist,
	nurse, or other licensed health care professional. You should also check product information (including package inserts) regarding dosage, precautions, warnings,
	interactions, and contraindications before administering or using any device, drug, herb, vitamin, or supplement discussed on the Service.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	You understand and agree that neither Big Pharma nor its suppliers or vendors are responsible for any claim, loss, or damage directly or indirectly resulting from
	your use of the Service or the information resources contained on or accessible through the Service.
	</p>
	
	
	<p>
	Proper treatment of health conditions depends upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, your medical history, diet, lifestyle, and medication
	regimen. Your health care provider can best assess and address your individual health care needs. You should consult with your health care provider before starting
	a new diet, fitness, or supplement regimen. <strong>IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING A MEDICAL CRISIS, PLEASE CALL 911 OR CONTACT YOUR LOCAL EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE SERVICE IMMEDIATELY.</strong>
	</p>
	
	
	<p>
	Information and statements about dietary supplements have not been evaluated by the US Food and Drug Administration and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure,
	mitigate, or prevent any disease or health condition. Big Pharma does not endorse manufacturers' or others' claims about the efficacy of these products. We specifically
	disclaim any guarantee or warranty, express or implied, with respect to any products or services sold, including any warranty of merchantability or fitness for a
	particular purpose. No information conveyed by Big Pharma either orally or in writing shall create such a warranty.

	<b>
	Products and Transcations
	</b>
	</h3>

	of such products or services and such products or services may be made available by Big Pharma or by third parties. Resale of products or services purchased in connection with 
	the Service is specifically prohibited. We reserve the right to refuse to sell products or services to you if it reasonably appears to us that you intend to resell such
	products or services. Verification of information may be required prior to our acceptance of any order. We further reserve the right to limit quantities of items purchased
	by each customer or to refuse to provide any customer with any such items. Your properly completed and delivered order form constitutes your offer to purchase the goods 
	or services referenced in your order. Your order shall be deemed to be accepted only if and when Big Pharma or its supplier or vendor sends an order acceptance and shipping 
	notice email to your email address.

	descriptions or images on the Service regarding any products or services, are subject to change without notice. Certain weights, measures and similar descriptions are
	approximate and are for convenience only. We seek to undertake reasonable efforts to accurately display the attributes of products and services, including the applicable
	colors, however the actual colors that you see will depend on your device, and we cannot guarantee that your device will accurately display such colors. 
	Certain non-prescription order and/or product returns may incur a restocking fee. In general, offers on the Service are good only while supplies last. Sweepstakes,
	giveaways, specials, sales, and other promotions offered at the Service may not be available in stores. Likewise, sales and specials offered in-store might not be 
	reflected online. It is your responsibility to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, and federal laws (including minimum age requirements) regarding the

	services, you grant to us the right to provide such information to third parties for purposes of facilitating such purchase. Verification of information may be required
	prior to the acknowledgment or completion of any transaction. You represent and warrant that you have the right to use any credit card or other method of payment that 
	you submit in connection with a transaction in connection with the Service. Further terms and conditions related to transactions in connection with the Service may apply.

	<h3>
	<b>
	Your Obligations
	</b>
	</h3>

	<p>
	You agree to use the Service only for lawful purposes. You agree not to interrupt or attempt to interrupt the operation of the Service in any way. Any conduct by you that, in 
	our sole discretion, restricts, inhibits, or interferes with the ability of any other user to enjoy the Service will not be tolerated, including by means of hacking or defacing
	any portion of the Service, or by engaging in spamming, flooding, or other disruptive activities. You are strictly prohibited from communicating on or through the Service 
	(including in connection with any Materials) any unlawful, harmful, offensive, threatening, abusive, libelous, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, profane, hateful, 
	fraudulent, sexually explicit, racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable material of any sort, including, but not limited to, any material that encourages conduct 
	that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any applicable local, state, national, or international law. We reserve the 
	right to terminate or suspend your access to and use of the Service, or parts of the Service, without notice, if we believe, in our sole discretion, that it is in violation
	of any applicable law or it is harmful to our interests or the interests, including intellectual property or other rights, of another user or other third party partners, 
	affiliates, sponsors, providers, licensors, or merchants.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	You must not post, transmit or otherwise make available through or in connection with the Service any virus or other computer code, file or program that is potentially harmful
	or invasive or intended to damage or hijack the operation of, or to monitor the use of, any hardware, software or equipment.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	You agree to provide true, accurate, current, and complete information in connection with the Service. It is your responsibility to maintain and promptly update this account
	information to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete. If you provide any information that is fraudulent, untrue, inaccurate, incomplete, or not current, or we have 
	reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is fraudulent, untrue, inaccurate, incomplete, or not current, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account
	without notice and refuse any and all current and future use of the Service. Because any termination of your access to the Service may be effected without prior notice, you
	acknowledge and agree that we may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your account and bar any further access to such files
	or the Service. Furthermore, you agree that we shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to your account or the Service.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	You may be asked to supply a user ID and password and other information to register to use all or part of the Service. We may refuse to grant you a user ID that impersonates
	someone else, is or may be illegal, is or may be protected by trademark or other proprietary rights law, is vulgar or otherwise offensive, or may cause confusion, as determined
	by us in our sole discretion. For security reasons, user IDs and passwords must be non-obvious, hard-to-guess, confidential and changed on a regular basis, and you must log out
	at the end of each session. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your user ID and password and are fully responsible for all activities (including 
	purchases, as applicable) that occur in connection with your user ID or password such that, for all purposes under this Agreement, any activities in connection with your 
	user ID or password will be deemed to be your activities. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of either your user ID or password or any other breach
	of security. You further agree that you will not permit others, including those whose accounts have been terminated, to access the Service using your user ID or password. 
	All user IDs and passwords remain the property of CVS, and may be cancelled or suspended at any time by CVS without any prior notice or any liability to you or any other 
	person. CVS is not under any obligation to verify the actual identity or authority of the user of any user ID or password. If CVS, in its sole discretion, considers a 
	password to be insecure, then CVS may cancel the password.
