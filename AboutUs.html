	At Big Pharma, we share a clear purpose: helping people on their path to better health. Through our health services, plans and community pharmacists,
	we’re pioneering a bold new approach to total health. Making quality care more affordable, accessible, simple and seamless, to not only help people get
	well, but help them stay well in body, mind and spirit. Big Pharma Health’s extensive suite of assets positions us to play an important role in solving the cost,
	quality and access issues in the evolving health care landscape. We work hard to develop a diverse workforce and provide a workplace that empowers all of
	our colleagues, regardless of their age, ethnicity or background. We have a long history of supporting the communities where we do business by giving 5 
	percent of our profit. We also volunteer our time and talent, partner with like-minded organizations to build stronger, safer, healthier communities, 
	and invest in the development and well-being of our team members.

	We believe diversity and inclusivity make teams and Big Pharma better. And we’ll live that belief as champions of a more inclusive society by creating a diverse
	and inclusive work environment, cultivating an inclusive guest experience, and fostering equality in society. You’re our guest when you shop with us, so we
	design every Big Pharma shopping experience to be the best you’ll ever have. From small-format stores that are right-sized and stocked for urban dwellers to an
	award-winning iPhone app that lets you shop on the go, your Big Pharma shopping experience will be unique and memorable.
	</P>
	
	<p>
	We set high standards for your Big Pharma experience—where you shop with us and in our company halls. We aim to be a place where guests and team members
	will always find more than they expect. Our purpose and beliefs set the stage, and day-to-day innovation, teamwork and community partnerships reflect who we are.
